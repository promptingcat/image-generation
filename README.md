# Why Image Generation LLMs Struggle with Simple Concepts – And What We Can Do About It

If you ask an AI to generate an image of a **football player scoring with their left foot**, a **glass of milk filled to the brim**, or a **clock showing 11:45**, 9 out of 10 times, you won’t get what you expect.  
*Don’t believe me? Try it yourself.*

## Why do image generation LLMs struggle with such seemingly simple requests?

It comes down to **compositional reasoning** and **spatial coherence**—two areas where AI models often fall short. Unlike humans, who intuitively understand object relationships, physics, and spatial constraints, AI models work by recognizing statistical patterns in their training data.

### Here’s why that leads to failures:

- **Ambiguous Training Data:**  
  “Filled to the brim” is a common phrase, but how many training images actually depict a liquid at surface tension?  
  Similarly, how often do datasets highlight “scoring with the left foot” versus just “scoring a goal”?

- **Lack of Spatial Awareness:**  
  Generative models don't *see* images as a whole; they construct them piece by piece. This can result in distorted clock hands, oddly placed limbs, or liquids floating in ways that defy physics.

- **Concept Misalignment:**  
  AI can understand a football player, a left foot, and a goal, but combining them into a coherent action is a different challenge.

- **Bias Toward the “Golden Standard”:**  
  Have you ever noticed that most watch advertisements show the time as 10:10?  
  That’s because it’s aesthetically pleasing and frames the brand logo nicely.  
  AI models trained on countless watch images tend to default to this "golden standard," making it surprisingly difficult to generate a watch showing 11:45.

## How Can We Fix This?

While these issues seem fundamental, we’re seeing promising solutions emerge:

1. **Better Data Curation**  
   Training on structured, annotated datasets that emphasize spatial relationships can improve outcomes.

2. **Hybrid Approaches**  
   Combining generative AI with physics-based models or reinforcement learning can help enforce real-world constraints.

3. **Prompt Engineering & Iterative Refinement**  
   Instead of a vague “football player scoring with left foot,” a more structured prompt like:  
   *“A professional footballer, left-footed, mid-strike, ball entering goal, natural motion, stadium background”*  
   can significantly enhance results.

4. **Post-Processing & Human-in-the-Loop**  
   Using AI-assisted corrections or fine-tuning images post-generation ensures higher accuracy.


## Try This Yourself!

Ask an AI to generate a perfectly full glass of milk or a clock showing 11:45, and let me know if you get a perfect result.  
Chances are, you’ll either get a half-full glass or a clock stubbornly showing 10:10.
